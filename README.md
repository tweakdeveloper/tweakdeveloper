# howdy y'all!

- i'm currently working on [iOS](https://github.com/tweakdeveloper/mrkdown-iOS)
  and [Android](https://github.com/tweakdeveloper/mrkdown-android) versions of an
  app to create [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) posts using Markdown, as well as an
  associated [backend in TypeScript](https://github.com/tweakdeveloper/mrkdown-do-backend)!
- some other small projects are in mind, so stay tuned for those!
