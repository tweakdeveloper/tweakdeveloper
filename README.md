# howdy y'all!

i'm nicola clark, a student studying computer information systems in johnson
county, KS.

due to GitHub's apparent unwillingness to tone down its push to get developers
on board with Copilot (why did i have a Copilot bar appear on github.com without
my input?), my projects will be relicensed under a weak copyleft license
[MPL-2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/) and moving to a self-hosted
server. link to come.
